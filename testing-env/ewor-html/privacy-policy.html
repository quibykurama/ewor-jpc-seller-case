                        <p>We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise. Data protection is of a
                            particularly high priority for EWOR. The use of the Internet pages of EWOR is possible
                            without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use special
                            enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If
                            the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such
                            processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.</p>
                        <p>The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone
                            number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation
                            (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable
                            to EWOR. By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform
                            the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use
                            and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection
                            declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.</p>
                        <p>As the controller, EWOR has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to
                            ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website.
                            However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute
                            protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer
                            personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.</p>
                        <p><strong>DEFINITIONS</strong></p>
                        <p>The data protection declaration of EWOR is based on the terms used by the European legislator
                            for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection
                            declaration should be legible and understandable for the general public, as well as our
                            customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would like to first explain the
                            terminology used.</p>
                        <p>In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms:</p>
                        <p><strong>Personal data</strong></p>
                        <p>Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person
                            (“data subject”). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or
                            indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification
                            number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the
                            physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that
                            natural person.</p>
                        <p><strong>Data subject</strong></p>
                        <p>Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data is
                            processed by the controller responsible for the processing.</p>
                        <p><strong>Processing</strong></p>
                        <p>Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on
                            sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording,
                            organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use,
                            disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or
                            combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.</p>
                        <p><strong>Restriction of processing</strong></p>
                        <p>Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting
                            their processing in the future.</p>
                        <p><strong>Profiling</strong></p>
                        <p>Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of
                            personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in
                            particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person’s performance at
                            work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour,
                            location or movements.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pseudonymisation</strong></p>
                        <p>Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data
                            can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional
                            information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to
                            technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to
                            an identified or identifiable natural person.</p>
                        <p><strong>Controller or controller responsible for the processing</strong></p>
                        <p>Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person,
                            public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the
                            purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such
                            processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific
                            criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.</p>
                        <p><strong>Processor</strong></p>
                        <p>Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which
                            processes personal data on behalf of the controller.</p>
                        <p><strong>Recipient</strong></p>
                        <p>Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which
                            the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities
                            which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with
                            Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data
                            by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules
                            according to the purposes of the processing.</p>
                        <p><strong>Third Party</strong></p>
                        <p>Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the
                            data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the
                            controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.</p>
                        <p><strong>Consent</strong></p>
                        <p>Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous
                            indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear
                            affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him
                            or her.</p>

                            system via an Internet browser.</p>
                        <p>Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A
                            cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through
                            which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which
                            the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the
                            individual browser of the data subject from other Internet browsers that contain other
                            cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique

                            purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website. The
                            website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access data each time the
                            website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus
                            stored on the user’s computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an
                            online shop. The online store remembers the articles that a customer has placed in the
                            virtual shopping cart via a cookie.</p>
                        <p>The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by
                            means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny
                            the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an
                            Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet
                            browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser
                            used, not all functions of our website may be entirely usable.</p>

                        <h3>COLLECTION OF GENERAL DATA AND INFORMATION</h3>
                        <p>The website of EWOR collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or
                            automated system calls up the website. This general data and information are stored in the
                            server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the
                            operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing
                            system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and
                            time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the
                            Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and
                            information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.
                        </p>
                        <p>When using these general data and information, EWOR does not draw any conclusions about the
                            data subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website
                            correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure
                            the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and
                            (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal
                            prosecution in case of a cyber-attack.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, EWOR analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the
                            aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an
                            optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the
                            server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.
                        </p>
                        <p>‍</p>
                        <h3>REGISTRATION ON OUR WEBSITE</h3>
                        <p>The data subject has the possibility to register on the website of the controller with the
                            indication of personal data. Which personal data are transmitted to the controller is
                            determined by the respective input mask used for the registration. The personal data entered
                            by the data subject are collected and stored exclusively for internal use by the controller,
                            and for his own purposes. The controller may request transfer to one or more processors
                            (e.g. a parcel service) that also uses personal data for an internal purpose which is
                            attributable to the controller.</p>
                        <p>By registering on the website of the controller, the IP address—assigned by the Internet
                            service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject—date, and time of the registration are
                            also stored. The storage of this data takes place against the background that this is the
                            only way to prevent the misuse of our services, and, if necessary, to make it possible to
                            investigate committed offenses. Insofar, the storage of this data is necessary to secure the
                            controller. This data is not passed on to third parties unless there is a statutory
                            obligation to pass on the data, or if the transfer serves the aim of criminal prosecution.
                        </p>
                        <p>The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary indication of personal data, is
                            intended to enable the controller to offer the data subject contents or services that may
                            only be offered to registered users due to the nature of the matter in question. Registered
                            persons are free to change the personal data specified during the registration at any time,
                            or to have them completely deleted from the data stock of the controller.</p>
                        <p>The data controller shall, at any time, provide information upon request to each data subject
                            as to what personal data are stored about the data subject. In addition, the data controller
                            shall correct or erase personal data at the request or indication of the data subject,
                            insofar as there are no statutory storage obligations. The entirety of the controller’s
                            employees are available to the data subject in this respect as contact persons.</p>

                        <h3>SUBSCRIPTION TO OUR NEWSLETTERS</h3>
                        <p>On the website of EWOR, users are given the opportunity to subscribe to our enterprise’s
                            newsletter. The input mask used for this purpose determines what personal data are
                            transmitted, as well as when the newsletter is ordered from the controller.</p>
                        <p>EWOR informs its customers and business partners regularly by means of a newsletter about
                            enterprise offers. The enterprise’s newsletter may only be received by the data subject if
                            (1) the data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the data subject registers for the
                            newsletter shipping. A confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address registered by
                            a data subject for the first time for newsletter shipping, for legal reasons, in the double
                            opt-in procedure. This confirmation e-mail is used to prove whether the owner of the e-mail
                            address as the data subject is authorized to receive the newsletter.</p>
                        <p>During the registration for the newsletter, we also store the IP address of the computer
                            system assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject at the
                            time of the registration, as well as the date and time of the registration. The collection
                            of this data is necessary in order to understand the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address
                            of a data subject at a later date, and it therefore serves the aim of the legal protection
                            of the controller.</p>
                        <p>The personal data collected as part of a registration for the newsletter will only be used to
                            send our newsletter. In addition, subscribers to the newsletter may be informed by e-mail,
                            as long as this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or a registration
                            in question, as this could be the case in the event of modifications to the newsletter
                            offer, or in the event of a change in technical circumstances. There will be no transfer of
                            personal data collected by the newsletter service to third parties. The subscription to our
                            newsletter may be terminated by the data subject at any time. The consent to the storage of
                            personal data, which the data subject has given for shipping the newsletter, may be revoked
                            at any time. For the purpose of revocation of consent, a corresponding link is found in each
                            newsletter. It is also possible to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time directly on
                            the website of the controller, or to communicate this to the controller in a different way.
                        </p>
                        <p>‍</p>
                        <h3>NEWSLETTER-TRACKING</h3>
                        <p>The newsletter of EWOR contains so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature
                            graphic embedded in such e-mails, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording
                            and analysis. This allows a statistical analysis of the success or failure of online
                            marketing campaigns. Based on the embedded tracking pixel, EWOR may see if and when an
                            e-mail was opened by a data subject, and which links in the e-mail were called up by data
                            subjects.</p>
                        <p>Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored
                            and analyzed by the controller in order to optimize the shipping of the newsletter, as well
                            as to adapt the content of future newsletters even better to the interests of the data
                            subject. These personal data will not be passed on to third parties. Data subjects are at
                            any time entitled to revoke the respective separate declaration of consent issued by means
                            of the double-opt-in procedure. After a revocation, these personal data will be deleted by
                            the controller. EWOR automatically regards a withdrawal from the receipt of the newsletter
                            as a revocation.</p>
                        <p>‍</p>
                        <h3>ROUTINE ERASURE AND BLOCKING OF PERSONAL DATA</h3>
                        <p>The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for
                            the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the
                            European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is
                            subject to.</p>
                        <p>If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European
                            legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked
                            or erased in accordance with legal requirements.</p>
                        <p>‍</p>
                        <h3>RIGHTS OF THE DATA SUBJECT</h3>
                        <p><strong>Right of confirmation</strong></p>
                        <p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the

                            being processed. If a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of confirmation, he
                            or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.</p>
                        <p><strong>Right of access</strong></p>
                        <p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the

                            this information. Furthermore, the European directives and regulations grant the data
                            subject access to the following information:</p>
                        <ul>

                            <li>where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if
                                not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;</li>
                            <li>the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of
                                personal data, or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data
                                subject, or to object to such processing;</li>
                            <li>the existence of the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;</li>
                            <li>where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available

                                22 (1) and (4) of the GDPR and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about
                                the logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such
                                processing for the data subject.</li>
                            <li>Furthermore, the data subject shall have a right to obtain information as to whether
                                personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international organisation.
                                Where this is the case, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the
                                appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer. If a data subject wishes to avail
                                himself of this right of access, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the
                                controller.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Right to rectification</strong></p>
                        <p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the

                            or her. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the
                            right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a
                            supplementary statement. If a data subject wishes to exercise this right to rectification,
                            he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.</p>
                        <p><strong>Right to erasure (Right to be forgotten)</strong></p>
                        <p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the
                            controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the
                            controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of
                            the following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not necessary:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they
                                were collected or otherwise processed.</li>
                            <li>The data subject withdraws consent to which the processing is based according to point
                                (a) of Article 6 (1) of the GDPR, or point (a) of Article 9 (2) of the GDPR, and where
                                there is no other legal ground for the processing.</li>
                            <li>The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21 (1) of the GDPR and
                                there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject
                                objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21 (2) of the GDPR.</li>
                            <li>The personal data have been unlawfully processed.</li>
                            <li>The personal data must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or
                                Member State law to which the controller is subject.</li>
                            <li>The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society
                                services referred to in Article 8 (1) of the GDPR.</li>
                            <li>If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject wishes to request the
                                erasure of personal data stored by EWOR, he or she may, at any time, contact any
                                employee of the controller. An employee of EWOR GmbH shall promptly ensure that the
                                erasure request is complied with immediately. Where the controller has made personal
                                data public and is obliged pursuant to Article 17 (1) to erase the personal data, the
                                controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall
                                take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform other controllers

                        <p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the
                            controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period
                                enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data.</li>
                            <li>The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data
                                and requests instead the restriction of their use instead.</li>
                            <li>The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but
                                they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of
                                legal claims.</li>
                            <li>The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21 (1) of the GDPR
                                pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those
                                of the data subject.</li>
                            <li>If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the
                                restriction of the processing of personal data stored by EWOR, he or she may at any time
                                contact any employee of the controller. The employee of EWOR will arrange the
                                restriction of the processing.</li>

                            have been provided, as long as the processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of
                            Article 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant

                            in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.
                        </p>
                        <p>Furthermore, in exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to Article 20 (1) of
                            the GDPR, the data subject shall have the right to have personal data transmitted directly
                            from one controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing so does not

                        <p><strong>Right to object</strong></p>
                        <p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to object, on
                            grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time, to processing of personal
                            data concerning him or her, which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6 (1) of the GDPR.
                            This also applies to profiling based on these provisions</p>
                        <p>EWOR shall no longer process the personal data in the event of the objection, unless we can
                            demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests,
                            rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of
                            legal claims.</p>
                        <p>If EWOR processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have

                            such marketing. This applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct
                            marketing. If the data subject objects to EWOR to the processing for direct marketing
                            purposes, EWOR will no longer process the personal data for these purposes.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the data subject has the right, on grounds relating to his or her particular
                            situation, to object to processing of personal data concerning him or her by EWOR for
                            scientific or historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article
                            89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried

                        <p>In order to exercise the right to object, the data subject may contact any employee of EWOR.
                            In addition, the data subject is free in the context of the use of information society
                            services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, to use his or her right to object by
                            automated means using technical specifications.</p>
                        <p><strong>Automated individual decision-making, including profiling</strong></p>
                        <p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator not to be subject

                            between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) is not authorised by Union or Member
                            State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to
                            safeguard the data subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is not
                            based on the data subject’s explicit consent.</p>
                        <p>If the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between
                            the data subject and a data controller, or (2) it is based on the data subject’s explicit
                            consent, EWOR shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject’s rights and
                            freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the
                            part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and contest the decision. If the
                            data subject wishes to exercise the rights concerning automated individual decision-making,
                            he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of EWOR.</p>

                        <h3>DATA PROTECTION FOR APPLICATIONS AND THE APPLICATION PROCEDURES</h3>
                        <p>The data controller shall collect and process the personal data of applicants for the purpose
                            of the processing of the application procedure. The processing may also be carried out
                            electronically. This is the case, in particular, if an applicant submits corresponding
                            application documents by e-mail or by means of a web form on the website to the controller.
                            If the data controller concludes an employment contract with an applicant, the submitted
                            data will be stored for the purpose of processing the employment relationship in compliance
                            with legal requirements. If no employment contract is concluded with the applicant by the
                            controller, the application documents shall be automatically erased two months after
                            notification of the refusal decision, provided that no other legitimate interests of the
                            controller are opposed to the erasure. Other legitimate interest in this relation is, e.g. a
                            burden of proof in a procedure under the General Equal Treatment Act (AGG).</p>

                        <h3>DATA PROTECTION PROVISIONS ABOUT THE APPLICATION AND USE OF FACEBOOK</h3>
                        <p>On this website, the controller has integrated components of the enterprise Facebook.
                            Facebook is a social network.</p>
                        <p>A social network is a place for social meetings on the Internet, an online community, which
                            usually allows users to communicate with each other and interact in a virtual space. A
                            social network may serve as a platform for the exchange of opinions and experiences, or
                            enable the Internet community to provide personal or business-related information. Facebook
                            allows social network users to include the creation of private profiles, upload photos, and
                            network through friend requests.</p>
                        <p>The operating company of Facebook is Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025,
                            United States. If a person lives outside of the United States or Canada, the controller is
                            the Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.</p>
                        <p>With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet website, which is operated
                            by the controller and into which a Facebook component (Facebook plug-ins) was integrated,
                            the web browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically
                            prompted to download display of the corresponding Facebook component from Facebook through
                            the Facebook component. An overview of all the Facebook Plug-ins may be accessed under
                            <strong><a
                                    href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/</a></strong>.
                            During the course of this technical procedure, Facebook is made aware of what specific
                            sub-site of our website was visited by the data subject.
                        </p>
                        <p>If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook, Facebook detects with every
                            call-up to our website by the data subject—and for the entire duration of their stay on our
                            Internet site—which specific sub-site of our Internet page was visited by the data subject.
                            This information is collected through the Facebook component and associated with the
                            respective Facebook account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the
                            Facebook buttons integrated into our website, e.g. the “Like” button, or if the data subject
                            submits a comment, then Facebook matches this information with the personal Facebook user
                            account of the data subject and stores the personal data.</p>
                        <p>Facebook always receives, through the Facebook component, information about a visit to our
                            website by the data subject, whenever the data subject is logged in at the same time on
                            Facebook during the time of the call-up to our website. This occurs regardless of whether
                            the data subject clicks on the Facebook component or not. If such a transmission of
                            information to Facebook is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent
                            this by logging off from their Facebook account before a call-up to our website is made.</p>
                        <p>The data protection guideline published by Facebook, which is available at <strong><a
                                    href="https://facebook.com/about/privacy/">https://facebook.com/about/privacy/</a></strong>,
                            provides information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by Facebook.
                            In addition, it is explained there what setting options Facebook offers to protect the
                            privacy of the data subject. In addition, different configuration options are made available
                            to allow the elimination of data transmission to Facebook. These applications may be used by
                            the data subject to eliminate a data transmission to Facebook.</p>
                        <p>‍</p>
                        <h3>DATA PROTECTION PROVISIONS ABOUT THE APPLICATION AND USE OF GOOGLE ANALYTICS AND HOTJAR</h3>
                        <p>On this website, the controller has integrated the component of Google Analytics (with the
                            anonymizer function). Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analytics is the
                            collection, gathering, and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites. A
                            web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website from which a person has
                            come (the so-called referrer), which sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what
                            duration a sub-page was viewed. Web analytics are mainly used for the optimization of a
                            website and in order to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.</p>
                        <p>The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House,
                            Barrow Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.</p>
                        <p>For the web analytics through Google Analytics the controller uses the application “_gat.
                            _anonymizeIp”. By means of this application the IP address of the Internet connection of the
                            data subject is abridged by Google and anonymised when accessing our websites from a Member
                            State of the European Union or another Contracting State to the Agreement on the European
                            Economic Area.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the traffic on our website.
                            Google uses the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our
                            website and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our websites, and to
                            provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site for us.</p>
                        <p>Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.
                            The definition of cookies is explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Google is
                            enabled to analyze the use of our website. With each call-up to one of the individual pages
                            of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and into which a Google Analytics
                            component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the
                            data subject will automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for the
                            purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Google. During the course
                            of this technical procedure, the enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal information,
                            such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Google, inter alia, to understand
                            the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently create commission settlements. The
                            cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from
                            which the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data subject.
                            With each visit to our Internet site, such personal data, including the IP address of the
                            Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to Google in the United States
                            of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google
                            may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.</p>
                        <p>The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at
                            any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently
                            deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also
                            prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the

                            time via a web browser or other software programs.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data that
                            are generated by Google Analytics, which is related to the use of this website, as well as
                            the processing of this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such. For this purpose,
                            the data subject must download a browser add-on under the link <strong><a
                                    href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a></strong> and
                            install it. This browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data
                            and information about the visits of Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google
                            Analytics. The installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by Google. If
                            the information technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted, or newly
                            installed, then the data subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google
                            Analytics. If the browser add-on was uninstalled by the data subject or any other person who
                            is attributable to their sphere of competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute the
                            reinstallation or reactivation of the browser add-ons.</p>

                        <p>On this website, the controller has integrated components of the service Instagram. Instagram
                            is a service that may be qualified as an audiovisual platform, which allows users to share
                            photos and videos, as well as disseminate such data in other social networks.</p>
                        <p>The operating company of the services offered by Instagram is Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand
                            Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2 Ireland.</p>
                        <p>With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by

                            Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically
                            prompted to the download of a display of the corresponding Instagram component of Instagram.
                            During the course of this technical procedure, Instagram becomes aware of what specific
                            sub-page of our website was visited by the data subject.</p>
                        <p>If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Instagram, Instagram detects with every

                            Internet site—which specific sub-page of our Internet page was visited by the data subject.
                            This information is collected through the Instagram component and is associated with the

                            Instagram buttons integrated on our website, then Instagram matches this information with
                            the personal Instagram user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.</p>
                        <p>Instagram receives information via the Instagram component that the data subject has visited
                            our website provided that the data subject is logged in at Instagram at the time of the call

                        <p>‍</p>
                        <h3>LEGAL BASIS FOR THE PROCESSING</h3>
                        <p>Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we
                            obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is
                            necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the
                            case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to
                            provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same
                            applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual
                            measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. Is our
                            company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such
                            as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR.
                            In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital
                            interests of the data subject or of another natural person. This would be the case, for
                            example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data
                            or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third
                            party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6 (1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing
                            operations could be based on Article 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for
                            processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if
                            processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company
                            or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or
                            fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal
                            data. Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been
                            specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest
                            could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2
                            GDPR).</p>
                        <p>‍</p>
                        <h3>THE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS PURSUED BY THE CONTROLLER OR BY A THIRD PARTY</h3>
                        <p>Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6 (1) lit. f GDPR our legitimate
                            interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and
                            the shareholders.</p>
                        <p>‍</p>
                        <h3>PERIOD FOR WHICH THE PERSONAL DATA WILL BE STORED</h3>
                        <p>The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective
                            statutory retention period. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is
                            routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract
                            or the initiation of a contract.Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual
                            requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract; Obligation of the data subject
                            to provide the personal data; possible consequences of failure to provide such data We
                            clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations)
                            or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual
                            partner). Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject
                            provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us. The data subject
                            is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract
                            with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the
                            contract with the data subject could not be concluded. Before personal data is provided by
                            the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee. The employee clarifies to the
                            data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is
                            necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the
                            personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.</p>
